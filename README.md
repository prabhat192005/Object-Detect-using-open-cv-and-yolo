# Project Title
Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO and OpenCV
Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates objects within images or videos. It goes beyond image classification by not only determining what is present in an image but also where it is located through bounding boxes. This capability is crucial in applications like surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and smart retail systems.

One of the most effective and popular methods for real-time object detection is YOLO (You Only Look Once), which can detect multiple objects in a single frame with high accuracy and speed. When combined with OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, YOLO becomes a powerful tool for real-time object detection applications.


## Project Overview
Using YOLOv3, this project detects multiple object classes in real time, leveraging a pre-trained model trained on the COCO dataset. This project showcases basic object detection capabilities, applying bounding boxes and labels to detected objects within each video frame.

## Features
- Real-time detection of 80 classes (from the COCO dataset) using YOLOv3.
- Displays bounding boxes and confidence scores for each detected object.
- Configurable to run on a webcam feed or on pre-recorded videos.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy

## Setup
Clone this repository (or download the project files manually):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/object-detection.git
cd object-detection
```
## Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
## Download YOLOv3 model files:
- [YOLOv3 weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
- [YOLOv3 configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/refs/heads/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
- [COCO names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/refs/heads/master/data/coco.names)
- Place the downloaded files (yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg, coco.names) in the same directory as the project file (ObjDet.py).

# Usage
Run the object detection script:
```bash
python ObjDet.py
```
## Code Breakdown
- Loading YOLO Model: The YOLO model is loaded with pre-trained weights and a configuration file, and the COCO datasetâ€™s class names are read into the program.
- Processing Video Frames: Each frame is captured from the webcam, pre-processed, and analyzed for object detections.
- Drawing Bounding Boxes: For each detected object with a confidence score above the threshold, a bounding box and label are displayed.

## Example Output
- Detected objects in real-time video feed are highlighted with bounding boxes, and each object has a label and confidence percentage.

# Notes
- Make sure to adjust the confidence threshold as needed for better performance.
- Ensure the model files are placed in the same directory as the script to avoid file path issues.
